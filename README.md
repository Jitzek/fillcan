## About the library

Fillcan aims to be a object-oriÃ«nted solution for communicating with the Vulkan API. It's main goals are as follows:
- Decrease the boilerplate code needed for talking with Vulkan.
- Handle the allocation and deallocation of memory within the objects that require it. Automatically deallocate memory once the object goes out of scope.
- Don't take away control from the user. Allow as many parameters to be tweaked by the application that implements the library.

## About the developer
Fillcan is the result of a school project requiring the student (me) to get familiar with computer graphics.
For this project I have written a 400+ page document researching Vulkan and designing a basic implementation. This document has taken a lot of information from the "Vulkan programming guide" written by Graham Sellers.

My main goal was to understand Vulkan enough to write my own implementation without the use of a tutorial (though I have taken inspiration from [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)). This project was and is never meant to be used within a production environment and will likely never reach a version 1.0 release, it is merely a learning experience for a curious software developer.
